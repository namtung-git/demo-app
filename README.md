# React with RobotFramework selenium - Automation testing showcase application
The best way to get to know any patterns is to get your hands dirty and try them out. I created this Animal Crossing demo application powered *React* and *RxJS*. [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview) is a library for simple and scalable events management based on the reactive programming philosophy. It's serving same purpose as *Redux*, but unlike *Redux* it doesn't give us guidelines how we should architect out application. *RxJS*.

An end to end (E2E) test automation, which tests your whole application as the way user uses it in browser, is implemented with RobotFramework-Selenium. For preparing test environment, please browse to [tests/](https://github.com/namtung-git/demo-app/tree/master/tests) folder for information.
